# AI APPS 2.0: A Portable AI Universe

Welcome to AI APPS 2.0, a creative suite and digital playground packed with AI-powered tools, mini-games, and utilities. This application is a demonstration of the versatile capabilities of the Google Gemini API, wrapped in a sleek, modern user interface.

This project is designed as a Progressive Web App (PWA), offering a fast, installable, and reliable experience with offline capabilities for non-AI features.

## üöÄ Add to Your AI Studio

You can add this application to your own Google AI Studio workspace to experiment with and modify the code.

1.  **[Click here to create a new Web App in AI Studio](https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1ZUvKzXmjQsWfc9tu75v2YlbyPBn_j2vV)**.
2.  Once your new project is created, you will need to copy the code for each file into the corresponding file in your AI Studio project.
3.  If you have this project running locally or on GitHub, you can copy the contents of `index.html`, `index.tsx`, `metadata.json`, etc., into the editor in AI Studio.
4.  Save the files, and the app will be running in your own workspace!

## ‚ú® Features

The application is divided into several creative zones:

*   **üé® Art Gallery & Image Generation**:
    *   Generate pixel art, GIFs, spritesheets, and even short videos from text prompts using Google's models (`imagen-4.0-generate-001`, `veo-2.0-generate-001`).
    *   Analyze an uploaded image to generate a descriptive prompt.
    *   Save, share, and manage your creations in a local gallery.

*   **ü§ó Hugging Face Studio (NEW!)**:
    *   A dedicated hub for tools powered by the Hugging Face platform.
    *   **Image Generation**: Create images with the powerful Stable Diffusion model.
    *   **AI Chat**: Converse with popular open-source models like Mistral and Llama.
    *   **Speech-to-Text**: Transcribe audio from files using the Whisper model.

*   **üéµ Music & Sound Suite**:
    *   **Text to Song**: Convert stories, poems, or ideas into 8-bit chiptune songs.
    *   **Media to Song**: Upload a video or audio file and let AI compose a theme song based on its mood.
    *   **Sound Library**: Generate unique 8-bit sound effects from a simple description.
    *   **Pixel Sequencer**: A powerful 16-step sequencer for composing your own chiptune melodies.

*   **üí¨ AI Chat & Assistants (Gemini)**:
    *   Chat with a diverse roster of specialized AI assistants, each with a unique personality and expertise, powered by `gemini-2.5-flash`.
    *   Enable Google Search for up-to-date, grounded responses.
    *   **File Q&A**: Upload an image, audio, or video file and ask questions about its content.

*   **üïπÔ∏è AI Zone (Mini-Games & Tools)**:
    *   A hub of classic games (Snake, Brick Breaker, Minesweeper), AI-powered challenges (Smart Tic-Tac-Toe, Guess The Prompt), and creative utilities (AI Oracle, Word Match).

*   **üîß Offline Tools**:
    *   A collection of creative tools that run entirely in the browser without needing an internet connection or spending credits.
    *   Transform images into sounds, songs, or ASCII/Emoji art based on pixel data.
    *   Reverse audio from video files or convert audio to MIDI locally.

## üöÄ Technology Stack

*   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
*   **AI Engines**:
    *   **Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)**: For text, chat, image/video generation, and real-time voice.
    *   **Hugging Face Inference API**: For Stable Diffusion image generation and Whisper audio transcription.
*   **Audio Synthesis**: Web Audio API for generating sounds and music.
*   **Offline Functionality**: Service Worker and Cache API for PWA capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1.  A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
2.  A **Google Gemini API Key**. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Running the Application

This project is set up as a static web application with no build step required.

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Set up your API Key**:
    This application requires an API key to be available as an environment variable:
    *   `API_KEY` for the Google Gemini API.

    The method for setting this depends on your local development server. For simple servers, you may need to replace `process.env.API_KEY` in the code with your actual key for testing purposes.

    **Note:** Never commit your API keys directly into your source code.

3.  **Serve the project**:
    You need a local web server to run the application due to ES module imports. A simple way to do this is using `npx`:
    ```bash
    npx serve
    ```
    This will start a server, and you can open the provided `localhost` URL in your browser.

## PWA Installation

This app is a Progressive Web App (PWA) and can be installed on your device for a native-like experience.

*   **Desktop (Chrome/Edge)**: Look for the install icon in the address bar.
*   **iOS (Safari)**: Tap the "Share" button, then select "Add to Home Screen".
*   **Android (Chrome)**: Tap the menu (three dots) and select "Install app".

This provides direct access from your home screen and enables offline access for non-AI features.
